# Schrodinger SciInfo

Schrodinger SciInfo is a platform aimed at supporting [Schrodinger](https://newsite.schrodinger.com/) affiliates with non-biochemistry backgrounds to learn important discipline-specific information on the job.

## Key Points
<strong>Interactivity:</strong> Allows users to display non-technical information about a compound from its SMILE representation

<strong>No Re-Inventing the Wheel:</strong> Built on an existing demo that we recognized could be repurposed effectively

<strong>Made for a General Audience:</strong> Mintains lay-language and includes features like a key term glossary and Q&A forum

## Features
<strong>Home Page (molecule search):</strong> Retrieve information about a compound from its SMILE representation

<strong>Key Term Glossary:</strong> Look up key biochem terms you may hear around Schrodinger

<strong>Q&A Platform:</strong> Ask and answer questions from fellow affiliates

## Future Directions
Enable search on common names of molecules as opposed to SMILEs (to better meet the needs of biochem novices)

Include reference to periodic table for element characters used in SMILEs

Add page/section about SMILE syntax (ex.: = → double bond, C → Carbon, etc.)
